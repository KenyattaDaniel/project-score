    "This is the followup to a project proposal I submitted as an assignment for the Data Programming in Python module at the University of London. My stated goal within the initial proposal was to develop a credit risk model that can be used by banks and financial institutions in the Caribbean Netherlands to \"measure and score the financial ability and responsibility of SMEs\" in repaying micro loans. The bank transactions of SME's would be the primary data used to train and evaluate the accuracy of such a credit risk model. Bank transactions are ideal because they offer a real time and ongoing insight into an individual's or business financial activities; particulary from a cashflow perspective. To that affect the bank transactions of TACT, an SME based in the Caribbean, was obtained, cleaned, explored and prepared for this next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>Following the initial project proposal, I carried out further research into the field of credit risk modelling for businesses. Traditionally banks and lending institutions use credit reports from external credit bureaus (e.g. TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian) in addition to financial statements when assessing the credit worthiness of [Micro, Small and Medium sized] businesses **(Astri, 2020)**. Essentially banks use this information to identify the probability of default (i.e. PD); the likelihood over a specified period, usually one year, that a borrower will not be able to make scheduled repayments **(Kenton, 2021)**. However, according to a report by the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (i.e. ASTRI), \"financial institutions seeking to assess the creditworthiness of MSMEs face a serious constraint and source of inefficiency in the lack of transparent management information available. Many banks prefer to lend to large enterprises rather than MSMEs because these enterprises are able to provide clear audited financial statements. It can be difficult for banks to evaluate MSMEs because they often do not have solid accounting systems in place\" **(Astri, 2020)**. In the Caribbean Netherland this problem is exacerbated by the fact that most businesses are defined as micro or small enterprises. As such are not required by NL GAAP to produce audited financial statements. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>Alternative data sources are increasingly being used to overcome challenges in assessing the credit worthiness of MSMEs. During my research I discovered that \"the use of bank transactions is [a] relatively new\" concept and is seen as an \"alternative data\" source within the space of credit risk modelling **(Luber, 2021)**. This is according to Equifax, one of the largest consumer credit reporting agencies worldwide. Alternative data also includes transactional data such as mobile phone usage, electricity consumption and social media data in addition to bank statements. The benefits of using alternative data for credit risk modeling include greater insights, data reliability, risk mitigation and continous monitoring. On the other hand, some key challenge in working with alternative data includes maintaining user privacy, the effort required in dataset feature engineering and in selecting the appropriate machine learning algorithms. On the last point, my research revealed that credit risk modelling has traditionally been seen as a classification problem; with a focus on identifying whether a user is likely to default or not. As a result, when it comes to applying machine learning algorithms to create traditional credit risk models, \"logistic regression is considered the industry's practice\" **(Verkade, 2018)**. However, my research also revealed that \"there is no single answer to the question of which machine learning algorithm is best to use for alternative credit scoring\" and that \"model selection therefore needs to be an exploratory process involving the continuous evaluation of multiple machine learning models **(Astri, 2020)**.\" \n"
